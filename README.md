# Hello :)

Just noticed I didn't upload this file and happened to delete the file during the weekly cleanup ... Hahah ?

Well anyway, I present to you a simple glitchy and overall horribly css'ed site wherin using the (almost) user friendly Google Map's Api to get nearby locations of (Restaurants, Hospitals, Schools, Banks) on user slected places (randomly chosen 6 for now).

The code logic is basic and almost minimal. Included code to have markers being clickable which (if data available) shows a tiny pop-up with dissmissable option, name, site address and address.

_Need more work here... *sigh_
