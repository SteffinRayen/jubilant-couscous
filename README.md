Task - A responsive website where, we can search for restaurants in cities. Somehow like a Zomato website but a lighter version.

I was assigned a task which is supposed to be completed within 3 days and submit it back to me. (starting Jan 12th)

This was just to test my ability and my way of approach to solve the problem.

The task details goes this way, 

1. Create a responsive website (preferably using Bootstrap) where, we can search for restaurants in cities...Somehow like a Zomato website but a lighter version.
2. There should be a dropdown for selecting cities and a search input for searching the restaurants in the selected city.
3. The resultant set of restaurants must be listed and on clicking on the restaurant name, it should take us to the restaurant page where, the details of the restaurant along with the feedback must be displayed.
4. Anyone who has entered that restaurants page must be able to submit their own review (like the review text and ratings).
5. You can use languages like Ajax and Jquery to submit the feedback for seamless user experience.
6. Feel free to use any APIs and data for the task.
7. You can use any language of your choice like PHP, Jquery, Ajax, HTML, CSS, NodeJS, Bootstrap or any other framework... and send the work in a zip file.

If you have deployed the app on Heroku, make sure you include the link of your heroku app.
